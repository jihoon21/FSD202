        즉, 컨텐트(웹폰트파일)를 가져와 네트워크로!
        
        - 호출방식:
        1. external 방식으로 불러오기
        - link요소를 사용하여 html 상단에 넣는다
        예) <link rel="stylesheet" href="cdn주소">
        
        2. import 방식으로 불러오기
        - @import 를 사용하여 css코딩구역 상단에 넣는다
        예) @import url(cdn주소)
        
        -> @font-face가 필요없음!!!
