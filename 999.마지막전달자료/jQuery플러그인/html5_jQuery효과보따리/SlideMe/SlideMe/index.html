Abstract: Content layout for the SlideMe application.
          Displays a red slider bar with a red knob and "iPhone" string.
          Knob turns green when you touch it, yellow when you move it, 
          and red when you lift your finger from it. The knob adjusts the
          font size of "iPhone" and appearance of the bar. The font size of
          "iPhone" increases if you move the knob to the right and decreases 
          if you move it to the left. The bar gets filled with black when you
          slide the knob.
