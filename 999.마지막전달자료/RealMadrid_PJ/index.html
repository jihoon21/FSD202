        <span>“A young defender with a real desire to learn and help the team”</span><br/><br/>
         
        <span>Varane began his football career at the age of just seven. He showed the first signs of his talent at the Football Training Centre in Liévin (France) and began to develop his outstanding feature as a player, his elegance on the ball. He began to star for the youth teams of Racing Club de Lens and at the age of 17 he made his debut for them in Ligue 1, going on to become one of the stars of the 2010-11 season.

        <span>“I’m a strong character and am committed to my club and my teammates”</span><br/><br/>
         
        <span>Pepe is technically impeccable, tactically perfect, has a great sense of positioning, speed, strength and intelligence. He is very strong in the air and is also elegant when playing the ball out of defence. Since he arrived at the club, Pepe has been a vital presence at the heart of the Real Madrid defence.

        <span>“Real Madrid are the best team there is”</span><br/><br/>
         
        <span>Toni Kroos has winning genes, having won the World Cup in the same season that he also won the Club World Cup, the UEFA Supercup, the Bundesliga and the German Cup. He comes to Madrid having played over 200 games for Bayern Munich and has more than 50 caps for Germany.

        <span>"All I know is I give my all for this shirt in every game"</span><br/><br/>
         
        <span>Álvaro Arbeloa is a versatile player who is a born leader inside and outside the dressing-room. These are the qualities that made him stand out in the Real Madrid youth team. In 2005 he captained Real Madrid Castilla and was one of the key players in their promotion to the Spanish Second Division, a promotion which had taken 14 years to achieve.

        <span>“Joining the best club in the world is a dream come true”</span><br/><br/>
         
        <span>Danilo's combination of power, pace and technique make him one of the best right backs on the international stage. Additionally, his spectacular physique and thunderous strike of the ball make him a real threat when he joins in with attacking moves.
